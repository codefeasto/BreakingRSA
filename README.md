This repository contains implementations to the attacks described in the infamous paper by Dan Boneh, [Twenty Years of Attacks on the RSA Cryptosystem](https://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/papers/RSA-survey.pdf) as well as some interesting RSA problems that I gathered over the years. 

The primary language of choice is python with a SageMath 10.2 kernel.
