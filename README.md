This repository contains implementations to the attacks described in the infamous paper by Dan Boneh, [Twenty Years of Attacks on the RSA Cryptosystem](https://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/papers/RSA-survey.pdf) as well as some interesting RSA problems that I gathered over the years. 

The primary language of choice is python with a SageMath 10.2 kernel.

## Twenty Years of Attacks on the RSA Cryptosystem

1. Recovering $p,q$ having $d$
2. Binding
3. Hastad's attack
4. Common modulus
5. Franklin-Reiter related message attack
6. Wiener's attack
7. Coppersmith's Attack (LLL) on a partially known message

## Some interesting RSA problems

1. ECCRSA (TU Delft CTF 2024)
2. krsa (integrity rsa 2024)
3. Redundancy (vsCTF 2023)
4. RSA se olous RSei (NTUAH4CK 3.0)
5. RSA-2024 (imaginaryCTF monthly - Round 42)
6. RSATogether (ECSC 2024)
7. small eqs (0xL4ugh 2024)
